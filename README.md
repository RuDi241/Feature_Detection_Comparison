# Problem
A set of labeled arabic handwriting images is provided. Create a model that can identify the writer based on the image. Use only classical computer vision techniques.
# Task
Apply different feature extraction algorithms (SIFT, ORB, AKAZE) to the dataset, cluster them and generate visual bag of words vector. Then train a suitable machine learning model on the VBOW. Compare the best models for each descriptors for invariance (translation, scaling, rotation, illumination, etc.)
